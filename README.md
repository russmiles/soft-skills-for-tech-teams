This repository contains all the materials that accompany the Soft Skills for Technical Teams series of workshops. These are free to use (with attribution please).

## Want to run a workshop?

The current core contributors to these materials are usually a good first port of call to engage with a facilitated delivery of one of these workshops. 

The intent is that these workshops will be given in the spirit of non-profit, although some compensation may need to be negotiated from time to time, for example if it is preferable if a workshop is delivered in person.

You are also free to take the materials here and run your own workshop. Videos of past workshops will be made available for familiarising yourself with the materials should you want to do-it-yourself.
